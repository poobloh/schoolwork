CS 310 Notes

Clicker questions:
The complexity of adding to the front of a linked list is [ O(1) ]
The complexity of adding to the end of a linked list is [ O(n) ] but [ O(1) with tail pointer]


Notes:
use .compareTo instead of .equals for duplicate objects
wants javadoc commenting

Stack = LIFO
Queue = FIFO


LINKED LISTS
===================================
Testing your linked list:
peek
iterators
stacks
queues

addfirst = O 1
addlast = O n or 1 with tail ptr
removefirst = O 1
removelast = O n
remove = O n
peekfirst = O 1
peeklast = O n or 1 with tail ptr

// All O(1)
addFirst
addLast (w/ tail ptr)
removeFirst
peekFirst
peekLast (w/ tail ptr)
size
isEmpty
isFull
makeEmpty

// All O(n)
contains
iterator
remove
addLast
removeLast
peekLast


STACKS
